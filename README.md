## Features

The main features in this project are:
1. My name, a recent photo and links to info about me, my work and how to contact me appear on this website
2. I created the website using Semantic, responsive HTML code and advanced CSS, including flexboxes
3. Project links open in a new window
4. Different color appears when hovering over a text link
5. Clicking on a link in the navigation takes you to that section on the website
6. The first application in the course shows as a larger box than the subsequent projects

I used ChromeDevTools to help debug issues.  I tested all the links and features, ie. hover, opening the project links in a new window, and pointing to the correct images from the nav.
